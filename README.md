# Industry_Project
Industry Project @Brainstation with our partner company, Microsoft.
The Industry Project is a 24-hour collaborative tech sprint challenging BrainStation students to create a digital solution for one of BrainStation’s Industry Partners. This project involves a comprehensive analysis of common cybersecurity breaches with the aim to transform data privacy settings and practices across multiple platforms, making them more appealing and secure for individuals. The team, consisting of data scientists, UX/UI designers, and software engineers, collaborated to build a product for Microsoft to improve data privacy and cybersecurity.

## Proposal

## Key Findings from Research

1. **Time Series Insights**: The frequency of breaches over the years can inform organizations about external events or shifts in the digital landscape that could affect the likelihood of breaches.
2. **Sector Analysis**: Different sectors have varying vulnerabilities. Sectors with more breaches such as the 'web' sector should prepare to invest more in cybersecurity measures.
3. **Breach Methods**: Defenses should be tailored according to the most common breach methods. For instance, if hacking is prevalent, intrusion detection systems and penetration testing can be more emphasized.
4. **Narrative Analysis**: Common words in breach narratives can point to patterns in the data. If words like "hacked," "data," and "information" are frequent, it underscores the need for better data protection measures.

### Prototype
#### Meet Alex Johnson
- Age: 35
- Occupation: Marketing Manager
- Tech-Savvy: Alex uses a variety of social media platforms and stays updated with the newest apps and features.

#### Key Pain Points
1. Data Privacy: Personal information shared on social media platforms might be misused or leaked, leading to identity theft or other privacy infringements.
2. Third-Party Apps: Alex worries about the potential risks associated with third-party apps and services that often request access to personal data.
3. Trust Issues: Difficult to trust social media companies, especially given the history of data scandals and controversies.

#### Quote
"In a world of endless connections, I find myself torn between sharing my story and guarding my data.”

### High Fidelity Prototype
A Microsoft Product designed to address the key pain points identified in the research and personified by our persona, Alex Johnson.

## Conclusion
Cybersecurity is a critical concern for all organizations. Understanding past breaches can help organizations improve their defenses and protect against future attacks. This analysis provides a deep dive into past breaches and offers actionable insights that organizations can implement to bolster their cybersecurity measures.

## Conclusion
Cybersecurity and data privacy are critical concerns for all individuals and organizations. Our proposal and prototype aim to address these concerns by empowering users to protect their personal data across platforms.

## Acknowledgements
This project would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the entire Triton Technology team. A special thanks to all the team members for their valuable contributions in building the product for Microsoft.
